# Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot running as a Google Cloud Function which interacts with the Meme Compiler API. Current functionality implements the basic commands:

```
/ping: Pong
/addvideo [url]: Add a video to the meme compiler
```

#### Setup

The bot reacts to an Interaction Endpoint URL which is triggered from the registered slash commands. We have to respond to PING requests as well as per the [documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/overview#setting-up-an-endpoint-acknowledging-ping-requests).

We decrypt Discord's requests with the Discord Public Key and send authenticated requests to the Meme Compiler API with the gcloud Identity Token.

**Important Note:** The gcloud Identity Token will change sometimes. I need to investigate when this happens, but if the token does change we need to redeploy the Discord cloud function.
